# Copy the rest of the application source code into the image.
# For `npm run dev` with hot-reloading, source code is typically volume-mounted from the host.
# This copy ensures the image has the code if not volume mounting, or for initial setup.

# This needs to match the port specified in your Vite config or dev script.
# Your docker-compose.yml maps host port 3000 to this container port.

# IMPORTANT: Ensure your "dev" script in package.json (e.g., "vite")
# is configured to listen on all network interfaces.
# Example package.json script: "dev": "vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173"
# If not specified, Vite might only listen on localhost, making it inaccessible from outside the container.
