"""
V1 ACS Media Handler - Three-Thread Architecture
===============================================

Implements the documented three-thread architecture for low-latency voice interactions:

🧵 Thread 1: Speech SDK Thread (Never Blocks)
- Continuous audio recognition
- Immediate barge-in detection via on_partial callbacks
- Cross-thread communication via run_coroutine_threadsafe

🧵 Thread 2: Route Turn Thread (Blocks on Queue Only)  
- AI processing and response generation
- Orchestrator delegation for TTS and playback
- Queue-based serialization of conversation turns

🧵 Thread 3: Main Event Loop (Never Blocks)
- WebSocket handling and real-time commands
- Task cancellation for barge-in scenarios
- Non-blocking media streaming coordination
