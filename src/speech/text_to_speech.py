    This function provides intelligent sentence boundary detection optimized for
    text-to-speech applications. It preserves punctuation marks to maintain
    natural prosody and intonation patterns during synthesis.

    The function handles multiple languages and scripts including:
    - English punctuation (., !, ?)
    - Chinese punctuation (。, ！, ？)
    - Japanese punctuation (。, ！, ？)
    - Spanish punctuation with inverted marks
    - Newline characters as sentence boundaries

    Args:
        text: Input text to split into sentences. Can contain mixed languages
              and various punctuation styles.

    Returns:
        List of sentence strings with trailing whitespace removed. Empty
        sentences are filtered out. Punctuation marks are preserved within
        each sentence for proper synthesis prosody.

        ```python
        text = "Hello world! How are you? Fine, thanks."
        sentences = split_sentences(text)
        # Returns: ["Hello world!", "How are you?", "Fine, thanks."]

        # Returns: ["Hello!", "你好！", "¿Cómo estás?"]
        ```

    Performance:
        - O(n) time complexity where n is text length
        - Minimal memory overhead with character-by-character processing
        - Optimized for real-time text processing in voice applications

    Optimization Logic:
    - Romance languages (Spanish, French, Italian): Use "chat" style with
      slightly faster rate (+3%) for improved conversational flow
    - English variants: Apply "chat" style with +3% rate for natural dialogue
    - Other languages: Return empty dict to use voice defaults

                   Case-insensitive, supports language-region codes like 'en-US'.

    Returns:
        Dictionary with optimal synthesis parameters:
        - 'style': Voice style name (e.g., 'chat', 'news', 'customerservice')
        - 'rate': Speech rate adjustment (e.g., '+3%', '-10%', '1.2x')

        Returns empty dict if no optimization available for the language.

    Example:

    Key Features:
    - Automatic language detection per sentence with graceful fallback
    - Language-specific style and rate optimization via auto_style()
    - Dynamic language switching within the same voice

               'es-ES-ElviraNeural'). Must be a valid neural voice identifier.
        language: Base language code for the document (e.g., 'en-US', 'es-ES').
                  Used as fallback when per-sentence detection fails.
        sentences: List of text segments to synthesize. Each segment is processed
                   independently for language detection and style optimization.
        sanitizer: Function to escape XML special characters (&, <, >, ", ').

    Language Detection Behavior:
        - Attempts automatic detection for each sentence using langdetect
        - Falls back to base language parameter on detection failure
        - Wraps foreign language segments in <lang> tags for proper pronunciation
        - Handles mixed-language content gracefully within single document

    Performance Optimizations:
        - Single voice container reduces Azure TTS processing overhead
        - Batch processing of multiple sentences in one request
        - Minimal SSML structure for faster parsing
        - Efficient string concatenation with list operations

    Error Handling:
        - Graceful fallback on language detection failures
        - Safe handling of empty or whitespace-only sentences
        - XML escaping prevents malformed SSML documents
        - Robust handling of unsupported language codes

    Azure TTS Compatibility:
        - Follows Azure Cognitive Services SSML specification v1.0
        - Supports Microsoft Text-to-Speech Service extensions
        - Compatible with neural voice styling and prosody features
        - Proper namespace declarations for all used elements

    This function provides lightweight heuristics to determine whether the current
    execution environment has audio output capabilities. It's used to prevent
    audio playback attempts in containerized deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and
    cloud server environments where audio hardware is not available.

    Detection Logic:
    1. Linux systems without DISPLAY environment variable:
       - Typical in Docker containers, cloud VMs, and server deployments
       - DISPLAY variable indicates X11 GUI session availability

    2. Continuous Integration environments:
       - CI environment variable is commonly set by CI/CD platforms
       - Includes GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, etc.

    3. Future extensibility:
       - Can be extended for Windows detection using SESSIONNAME
       - Supports additional platform-specific indicators

    Returns:
        True if running in headless environment (no audio output expected).
        False if audio output capabilities are likely available.

    Example:
        ```python
        if _is_headless():
            print("Audio playback disabled - headless environment")
            return None  # Skip speaker initialization

            return create_audio_output()
        ```

    Platform Support:
        - Linux: Checks DISPLAY environment variable
        - Windows: Placeholder for future SESSIONNAME detection
        - macOS: Inherits from UNIX-like behavior
        - CI/CD: Universal CI environment variable detection

    Performance:
        - O(1) operation with minimal system calls
        - Safe for frequent invocation
        - No external dependencies or network calls

    Environment Variables Checked:
        - DISPLAY: X11 display server indicator (Linux/Unix)
        - CI: Generic CI/CD environment flag
        - (Future) SESSIONNAME: Windows session type indicator

    Use Cases:
        - Docker container audio policy decisions
        - Cloud deployment configuration
        - CI/CD pipeline optimization
        - Development vs. production environment detection
        - Automated testing in headless browsers

    Note:
        These heuristics provide reasonable defaults but may not cover all
        edge cases. Consider adding application-specific environment variables
        for explicit audio policy control when needed.

        Initialization Behavior:
            - Lazy loading: Audio hardware components created only when needed
            - Fail-safe: Continues initialization even if tracing setup fails
            - Validation: Speech config created and validated during initialization
            - Logging: Comprehensive initialization status and error reporting

        Performance Considerations:
            - Minimal initialization overhead with lazy component loading
            - Efficient credential caching for repeated authentications
            - Tracing overhead only when enabled and properly configured
            - Memory-efficient design suitable for long-running applications

        Thread Safety:
            - Instance variables are set once during initialization
            - No shared mutable state between concurrent operations
            - Thread-safe for all synthesis methods after initialization
            - OpenTelemetry spans properly isolated per thread

        Note:
            Audio hardware detection occurs lazily during first playback attempt.
            This prevents initialization failures in headless environments while
            preserving playback capabilities when hardware becomes available.

                               Typically provided by Azure Communication Services,
                               telephony systems, or application session managers.
                               Should be unique across the system and time.

        Performance:
            - O(1) operation with no system calls
            - Minimal memory overhead
            - Safe for frequent updates during call transfers

        Integration Points:

        This method establishes a connection to Azure Cognitive Services Speech
        using the most appropriate authentication method based on available credentials.
        It handles token expiration, credential refresh, and provides comprehensive
        error handling for various deployment scenarios.

        Authentication Flow:
        1. API Key Method (preferred if available):
           - Uses subscription key and region for direct authentication
           - Simple and reliable for development and testing
           - Credentials from constructor parameters or environment variables

        2. Azure Default Credentials (production recommended):
           - Leverages Azure AD authentication with automatic token refresh
           - Supports managed identity, service principal, and credential chains
           - Requires AZURE_SPEECH_RESOURCE_ID environment variable
           - Provides enhanced security and eliminates key management

        Returns:
            speechsdk.SpeechConfig: Configured Speech SDK config object ready
            for synthesis operations. Includes language, voice, and format settings.

        Raises:
            ValueError: When region is missing for Default Credential authentication.
            RuntimeError: When authentication fails or no valid method available.
            Exception: For credential token acquisition failures or config errors.

        Configuration Applied:
            - speech_synthesis_language: Set to instance language (e.g., 'en-US')
            - speech_synthesis_voice_name: Set to instance voice name
            - output_format: Set to 24kHz 16-bit mono PCM for high quality

        Environment Variables Used:
            - AZURE_SPEECH_KEY: Subscription key for API authentication
            - AZURE_SPEECH_REGION: Azure region for service endpoint
            - AZURE_SPEECH_ENDPOINT: Custom endpoint URL (optional)
            - AZURE_SPEECH_RESOURCE_ID: Resource ID for AAD authentication

        Token Management:
            - Fresh token acquired on each call to handle expiration
            - Automatic refresh through Azure credential chain
            - Proper token format for Azure AD authentication
            - Error handling for token acquisition failures

        Example Usage:
            ```python
            # Internal method - called automatically during initialization
            try:
                config = synthesizer._create_speech_config()

                print(f"Authentication failed: {e}")
            ```

        Performance Considerations:
            - Token acquisition may involve network calls
            - Credential caching handled by Azure SDK
            - Config creation is relatively lightweight
            - Should not be called frequently due to auth overhead

        Security Features:
            - No credential logging or exposure
            - Secure token handling with automatic cleanup
            - Support for enterprise AAD authentication
            - Credential chain fallback for maximum flexibility

        Error Recovery:
            - Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
            - Graceful handling of credential failures
            - Clear guidance for configuration fixes
            - Comprehensive logging for debugging

        Note:
            This method creates a fresh configuration each time to ensure
            token freshness and handle credential rotation. The configuration
            should be cached at the instance level to avoid repeated auth calls.

        This method creates a Speech SDK synthesizer configured for local audio
        playback based on the instance's playback mode and environment detection.
        It provides flexible audio output management for different deployment
        scenarios from development to production containers.

        Playback Mode Behavior:

        "never" Mode:
            - Never attempts to create audio output synthesizer
            - Suitable for headless deployments and batch processing
            - Returns None immediately without hardware detection

        "auto" Mode (recommended):
            - Creates synthesizer only when audio hardware likely available
            - Uses headless environment detection for intelligent decisions
            - Prevents audio errors in containerized deployments
            - Enables local playback in development environments

        "always" Mode:
            - Always attempts to create synthesizer regardless of environment
            - Uses null audio sink in headless environments (no actual output)
            - Useful for testing audio processing without speaker requirements
            - May log warnings in environments without audio capabilities

        Returns:
            speechsdk.SpeechSynthesizer or None: Configured synthesizer for
            audio playback, or None if playback disabled or unavailable.

            The synthesizer is cached for subsequent calls to avoid repeated
            hardware detection and initialization overhead.

        Environment Detection:
            - Checks for GUI display availability (DISPLAY environment variable)
            - Detects CI/CD pipeline environments (CI environment variable)
            - Identifies containerized deployments without audio hardware
            - Uses platform-specific heuristics for accurate detection

        Audio Configuration:
            - use_default_speaker=True: Uses system default audio device
            - filename=None: Null sink for headless "always" mode
            - Inherits speech config settings from instance configuration

        Example Usage:
            ```python
            # Internal method - called automatically during playback
            synthesizer._speaker = synthesizer._create_speaker_synthesizer()

            if synthesizer._speaker:

                logger.info("Audio playback not available")
            ```

        Caching Behavior:
            - Speaker synthesizer created once and cached
            - Subsequent calls return cached instance for efficiency
            - Cache cleared only when instance destroyed
            - No automatic refresh for hardware changes

        Error Handling:
            - Graceful fallback when audio hardware unavailable
            - Comprehensive logging for debugging audio issues
            - Returns None on any speaker creation failure
            - No exceptions raised to avoid disrupting synthesis

        Performance Considerations:
            - Lazy initialization only when actually needed
            - Hardware detection cached to avoid repeated system calls
            - Minimal overhead for non-playback use cases
            - Efficient reuse of created synthesizer instances

        Thread Safety:
            - Safe to call from multiple threads
            - First caller creates and caches the synthesizer
            - Subsequent calls return cached instance
            - No race conditions in synthesizer creation

        Resource Management:
            - Audio resources automatically managed by Speech SDK
            - Synthesizer lifecycle tied to parent instance
            - Proper cleanup when parent instance destroyed
            - No manual resource disposal required

        Note:
            Audio hardware availability is detected at creation time.
            If hardware becomes available after instance creation,
            the synthesizer won't automatically detect the change.
            Consider recreating the instance or clearing the cache.

    @staticmethod
    def _sanitize(text: str) -> str:
        """Escape XML-significant characters for safe SSML document construction.

        This static method provides essential XML escaping to prevent SSML
        parsing errors when user-provided text contains special characters.
        It ensures that text content can be safely embedded within SSML
        elements without breaking document structure or syntax.

        Characters Escaped:
        - & (ampersand) → &amp; (entity references)
        - < (less than) → &lt; (opening tags)
        - > (greater than) → &gt; (closing tags)
        - " (double quote) → &quot; (attribute values)
        - ' (single quote) → &#x27; (attribute values)

        Args:
            text: Raw text string that may contain XML-significant characters.
                  Can include user input, dynamic content, or multilingual text
                  that needs to be safely embedded in SSML documents.

        Returns:
            Escaped text string safe for inclusion in SSML XML documents.
            All XML-significant characters are replaced with their entity
            references while preserving the original text meaning.

        Example:
            ```python
            # User input with special characters
            user_text = 'Say "Hello & welcome!" with <emphasis>'
            safe_text = SpeechSynthesizer._sanitize(user_text)
            # Result: 'Say &quot;Hello &amp; welcome!&quot; with &lt;emphasis&gt;'

            # Can now be safely used in SSML
            ssml = f'<speak><voice name="en-US-JennyNeural">{safe_text}</voice></speak>'
            ```

        Use Cases:
            - User-generated content in voice applications
            - Dynamic text from databases or APIs
            - Multilingual content with special punctuation
            - Template-based SSML generation
            - Real-time text processing in voice assistants

        Performance:
            - O(n) time complexity where n is text length
            - Minimal memory overhead with efficient string operations
            - Safe for high-frequency calls in real-time applications
            - No external dependencies or network calls

        SSML Compatibility:
            - Follows XML 1.0 specification for character escaping
            - Compatible with Azure Cognitive Services SSML parser
            - Preserves Unicode characters and multilingual content
            - Does not interfere with legitimate SSML markup

        Security Considerations:
            - Prevents XML injection attacks through user input
            - Ensures SSML document well-formedness
            - Safe for processing untrusted text content
            - No risk of malformed synthesis requests

        Note:
            This method only escapes content text, not SSML markup.
            If you need to include actual SSML tags in your text,
            they should be added after sanitization during document
            construction to maintain proper XML structure.
